I'll use this document to write down my thoughts behind the changes in each commit:

### Commit 1: App setup
This commit is just about setting up the repository the way I want it and getting ready to start development. For this, I used Vite with the React + TS template to get things going quickly, because there's no need to reinvent the wheel. I've also added the testing libraries and config needed since they're part of the essentials.
